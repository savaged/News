# News
Some fun learning C# events and messaging with an example system that posts news.

## Learning objectives
* Understand the basics of events in C#
* Understand a basic messaging 'pattern' implementation
* Understand the different usage of the two

### Clues
* Events can be used within the running process domain to allow access to any news updates for any subscriber
* Messaging can be used for the above too but can also be used across separate processes to send restricted/private news updates to specified subscribers
